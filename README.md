## Systems of equations

In this folder, you can find the systems corresponding to each test case presented in Section IV, as well as the symmetry-invariant change of variables presented in Section III-B.

## Numerical solutions

In this folder, you can find the numerical solutions (approximated to the nearest thousandth) for all the test cases presented in Section IV, expressed in camera state-space.
