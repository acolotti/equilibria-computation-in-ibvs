## Systems of equations

In this folder, you can find the systems corresponding to each test case presented in Section IV, as well as the symmetry-invariant change of variables presented in Section III-B (for the 4 points case only).

In each file, 
the first line denotes the system's variables, 
the second line is the characteristic of the field over which the computations are performed, 
the third line introduces a supplementary artificial variable to help `msolve` (see below) solve efficiently the complete system, 
and the subsequent lines represent the actual system of equations.

These systems are meant to be solved with `msolve` (https://msolve.lip6.fr), which is an open-source, high-performance library for computing the real roots of zero-dimensional polynomial systems that relies on Gr√∂bner bases algorithms.

Once `msolve` is installed, it's possible to solve a system by launching the following command:
```console
./msolve -f Case_XY.sys -o Case_XY.sols
```
where the `msolve` executable is located in the `/msolve_installation/binary` folder.

The solutions will be saved in the `Case_XY.sols` file. The solutions are given as a list in the order of variables given on the first line, the value of a variable being represented as an interval in which it is contained. The pose corresponding to a solution can then be obtained using the algorithm given in Table III. Solutions from which at least one point depth is nonpositive can be removed before computing the pose.

## Numerical solutions

In this folder, you can find the numerical solutions (approximated to the nearest thousandth) for all the test cases presented in Section IV, expressed in camera state-space.
